In this competition we are given 79 explanatory variables (79 features) describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition is to predict the final price of each home.For each Id in the test set, we have to predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 


This project requires:


1)Creative feature engineering 


2)Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting


 Approach to the problem:
 This is a supervised learning problem.<br /> 
 And to we are going to predict the housing price of the test data using the given 79 training.
 <br />
In this we have 2 data sets - train dataset (to train the model) and test dataset (we have to predict housing prices of this dataset)
<br />
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
<br />
We have categorical, numerical and boolean features in our data.
For feature engineering we will analyse each and every feature of our dataset, So that we can remove, merge, and transform our features So that we can get the optimal best set of feature to trian our model.
