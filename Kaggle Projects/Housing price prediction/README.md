In this competition we are given 79 explanatory variables (79 features) describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition is to predict the final price of each home.For each Id in the test set, we have to predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 


This project requires:


Creative feature engineering 


Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting


Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
